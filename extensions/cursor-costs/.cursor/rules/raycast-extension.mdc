# Raycast Extension Store Requirements

## Package.json Requirements

- Use your **Raycast account username** in the `author` field
- Use `MIT` in the `license` field
- Use the latest Raycast API version
- Set `platforms` field matching extension requirements (e.g., `["macOS"]` for platform-specific APIs)
- Always include `package-lock.json` (use npm, not yarn)

## Naming Conventions (Apple Style Guide)

### Extension Title

- Use **Title Case**: `Cursor Costs`, `Google Workplace`
- Make it easy to understand what extension does
- Prefer nouns over verbs: `Emoji Search` not `Search Emoji`
- Avoid generic names for single-command extensions

### Command Titles

- Structure: `<verb> <noun>` or just `<noun>`
- Examples: `Search Recent Projects`, `Create Task`, `Open Issues`
- Avoid articles: `Search Emoji` not `Search an Emoji`

### Command Subtitles

- Use to add context (usually service/app name)
- Don't use as description
- Omit if it duplicates command title

## Action Panel Guidelines

- Use **Title Case** for action titles: `Open in Browser`, `Copy to Clipboard`
- Provide icons for all actions if any action has an icon
- Add ellipses `…` for actions with submenus
- Don't repeat parent action name in submenu items

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Preferences

- Use `required: true` for essential preferences (Raycast shows onboarding)
- Don't build separate configuration commands

### Navigation

- Use Navigation API for pushing screens
- Don't implement custom navigation stacks

### Empty States

- Use `List.EmptyView` or `Grid.EmptyView` for empty states
- Prevent flickering: don't return empty list before data loads
- Show loading indicator while fetching data

### Navigation Title

- Don't change `navigationTitle` in root command (auto-set to command name)
- Use only in nested screens for context
- Keep titles short

### Placeholders

- Add placeholders in text fields and search bars
- Never leave search bar without placeholder

## Error Handling

- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- For authentication errors, provide clear instructions
- Use `void` for fire-and-forget promises: `void open(url)`

## Code Quality

- Run `npm run build` before submitting
- Run `npm run lint` to check for issues
- Remove unused assets and icons

## CHANGELOG Format

```markdown
## [Change Title] - {PR_MERGE_DATE}

- Change description
- Another change
```

- Title in square brackets
- Date after hyphen with spaces
- Use bullet points for changes
