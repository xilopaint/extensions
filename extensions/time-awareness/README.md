# 🩷 Time Awareness

Stay mindful of your time with Raycast.

## Features

- **Intelligent Tracking**: Uses macOS idle time to accurately track when you are actually active.
- **Celebrations**: Get notified and celebrate when you reach your time block milestone with a custom native Raycast confetti burst and HUD notification.
- **Customizable**: Configure your time block and idle threshold in the extension preferences.
- **Session Management**: Easily refresh or reset your session from the menu bar.

## How It Works

1. **Time Block**: Set your goal (default: 25 minutes).
2. **Idle Threshold**: If you stay away from your computer for longer than this (default: 3 minutes), the session pauses and eventually resets to keep your data accurate.
3. **Celebration**: Every time you hit your time block, enjoy a celebratory confetti blast! 🥳
