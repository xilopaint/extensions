# System Monitor

This is a [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) extension that allows you to monitor your system's CPU, Memory, Disk and Battery usage.

❕ You can toggle between free and used display modes for CPU, Memory and more in `Preferences`.

## Custom Menubar Text

❕ You can customise the menubar dropdown text in `Preferences`. Hover over the textbox to see what tags are available for each module. There are two tags that are always available: `<BR>` adds a linebreak, and `<MODE>` shows "Free" and "Used" depending on display mode.
