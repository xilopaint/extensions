## The Problem

YouTube is full of valuable content, but finding that one quote, concept or moment you remember from a video you recently watched can be a pain. Scrubbing through hours of content to rediscover a 30-second insight is not a good use of your time.

This extension lets you mark those moments as you watch, so you can come back to them without the hunt.

## What You Can Do

- **Create highlights** while watching YouTube in Arc browser. The extension captures the current timestamp and a configurable duration before it.
- **Add notes** to your highlights for context.
- **View all your highlights** in chronological order or grouped by video.
- **Search** through your highlights by text or video title.
- **Export** highlights to Markdown, JSON, or CSV.

## Requirements

- macOS
- Arc browser
- A YouTube video playing in Arc

## Getting Started

1. Open a YouTube video in Arc browser
2. Use the **Create Highlight** command to capture the current moment
3. Optionally add a note
4. View your highlights using **View Recent Highlights** or **Search Videos**

## Cloud Backup (Optional)

Sign in with your account to:

- Back up your highlights to the cloud
- Sync highlights across devices (Pro)

Without signing in, all highlights are stored locally on your Mac.

## Preferences

- **Highlight Duration**: How many seconds before the current timestamp to capture (default: 30)
- **Enable Arc Browser**: Toggle Arc browser support
- **Show note input after highlight**: Prompt for a note after creating each highlight

## Export Options

Export your highlights in multiple formats:
